<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project evaluates vendor performance and retail inventory dynamics to drive strategic insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization. A complete data pipeline was built using SQL for ETL, Python for analysis and hypothesis testing, and Power BI for visualization.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Effective inventory and sales management are critical in the retail sector. This project aims to:
- Identify underperforming brands needing pricing or promotional adjustments
- Identify vendors and brands that demonstrate the highest sales performance
- Determine vendor contributions to sales and profits
- Analyze the cost-benefit of bulk purchasing
- Investigate inventory turnover inefficiencies
- Statistically validate differences in vendor profitability
- Identify top vendors providing enhanced net benefit by determining risk score depending on ranking based on profit margin

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-cleaning--preparation"></a>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>

- Removed transactions with:
  - Gross Profit â‰¤ 0
  - Profit Margin â‰¤ 0
  - Sales Quantity = 0
- Created summary tables with vendor-level metrics
- Converted data types, handled outliers, merged lookup tables
- Ranked vendors based on total sales dollars, gross profit, profit margin and stock turnover

<h2><a class="anchor" id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

**Negative or Zero Values Detected:**
- Gross Profit: Min -52,002.78 (loss-making sales)
- Profit Margin: Min -âˆž (sales at zero or below cost)
- Unsold Inventory: Indicating slow-moving stock

**Outliers Identified:**
- Huge variation, from 0.09 to 257,032.07, suggests logistics inefficiencies or bulk shipments.
- Large Purchase/Actual Prices, max values (5,681.81 & 7,499.99) are significantly higher than the mean (24.39 & 35.64)

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Weak negative correlation between Vendor Ranking and Gross Profit (-0.04).
- Strong between Purchase Qty & Sales Qty (0.9)
- Moderate Negative between Profit Margin & Sales Price (-0.59)
- Weak negative correlation between Stock Turnover vs Gross Profit (-0.04)

<h2><a class="anchor" id="research-questions--key-findings"></a>Research Questions & Key Findings</h2>

1. **Brands for Promotions**: 13 brands with low sales but high profit margins
2. **Top Vendors**: Top 10 vendors = 76.33% of purchases â†’ risk of over-reliance
3. **Bulk Purchasing Impact**: 67.57% cost savings per unit in large orders
4. **Inventory Turnover**: $36.22k worth of unsold inventory
5. **Vendor Profitability**:
   - High Vendors: Mean Margin = 57.08
   - Low Vendors: Mean Margin = 50.66
6. **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistically significant difference in profit margins â†’ distinct vendor strategies
7. **Vendor consolidation**: Top vendors have significantly higher profit margins on average than low-performing vendors, as their confidence intervals do not overlap much.
8. **Low-Performing Vendors**:Their low sales volume might indicate a need for better marketing, competitive pricing, or improved distribution strategies
